# Introduction

This exercise undertaken by Team 10 serves as a practical immersion into the realms of exploratory testing, manual scripted testing, and regression testing, focusing on a designated System Under Test (SUT). Recognizing the team's predominantly theoretical knowledge acquired in classroom settings, the objective is to translate concepts into hands-on expertise. The dual approach of exploratory testing, mirroring user interactions, and manual testing plans, fostering structured and repeatable methodologies, unfolds as a powerful strategy for identifying and addressing software bugs. Versions 1.0 and 1.1 of the software are provided, allowing the team to emulate various stages in the testing and development life cycle of an application. This report encapsulates the team's utilization of JIRA as a proficient tool for meticulously documenting and tracking discovered bugs and defects during the testing process, contributing to an enriched understanding of software testing methodologies.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

For exploratory testing, the functionality of the system will be tested. The operations that will be tested for the functionality testing are deposit, withdraw, balance inquiry, and transfer. Next the system’s ability to authenticate users based on hard-coded card numbers and pins will be verified. The initial account balances for checking, savings, and money market accounts will be validated. Error handling and logging of transactions will also be tested. Finally, the GUI usability and responsiveness along with the system stability will also be tested.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

During this assignment, we employed both Exploratory and Manual Functional Testing (MFT) methodologies to comprehensively evaluate the System Under Test (SUT). MFT, characterized by its structured nature, is acknowledged as a time-consuming process for developers, yet it proves more efficient downstream in the testing process due to its predefined list of tests. However, the limitations of MFT became apparent as any use cases not covered in the predefined test cases risked being overlooked. On the other hand, Exploratory Functional Testing (EDA) offered greater flexibility, uncovering unforeseen issues that might escape the confines of predetermined scenarios. For instance, a critical bug related to fund transfers under $0.5 was uniquely discovered through EDA, illustrating its efficacy in identifying unexpected scenarios.

Comparision Summary:

Flexibility vs. Structure: Exploratory testing offers flexibility and adaptability, while manual functional testing provides a structured and repeatable framework.
Early Detection vs. Comprehensive Coverage: Exploratory testing excels in early bug detection and user-centric issues, while manual functional testing ensures comprehensive coverage and validation of specified requirements.
Efficiency vs. Precision: Exploratory testing is efficient for quick feedback, whereas manual functional testing is precise and suitable for in-depth validation.
Skill Dependency: Exploratory testing relies on the tester's creativity and intuition, whereas manual functional testing demands adherence to predefined test cases, reducing reliance on tester expertise.

Ultimately, the choice between exploratory and manual functional testing depends on project requirements, timelines, and the specific objectives of the testing phase. Often, a combination of both approaches proves beneficial for a well-rounded testing strategy.

In conclusion, both testing methodologies contribute crucial perspectives to the testing process. The unstructured nature of Exploratory Testing allows for the discovery of unexpected scenarios, while the highly structured Manual Functional Testing ensures comprehensive coverage of core functionalities. By integrating these methodologies, the limitations of each are mitigated: MFT systematically tests specified functionalities, while Exploratory Testing fills gaps by exploring unpredictable user behavior. Together, they establish a robust and thorough examination, enhancing the resilience and reliability of the software product.


# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

Given the team's collective lack of testing experience, there was an initial underestimation of the requisite attention to detail in each testing phase. The implementation of pair testing proved instrumental in identifying bugs that might have been overlooked by individual team members. Recognizing the need for a comprehensive tracking system, a customized Jira report was devised, drawing upon the experience of one team member.

Significant discourse within the team revolved around instances of overlooked bugs. For instance, a team member initially failed to observe the necessity of entering the PIN twice after an incorrect attempt. However, collaborative discussions with another pair facilitated the identification and documentation of this particular bug.

Moreover, deliberations arose concerning the prioritization of bugs. While certain issues, like incorrect cash dispensing, were straightforwardly categorized as high priority, others, such as the absence of transfer functionality between savings accounts, necessitated thorough discussions among all team members to ascertain the appropriate priority level.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

During pair testing, the team members collectively determined the specific role each member would assume. This process included assigning one team member as the tester and another as the individual responsible for reviewing the results. Each pair engaged in testing activities, and midway through, roles were swapped to ensure that every group member had the chance to be both the tester and the reviewer, facilitating a comprehensive learning experience. The workload for both Manual Scripted Testing and Regression Testing was evenly distributed among pairs.
